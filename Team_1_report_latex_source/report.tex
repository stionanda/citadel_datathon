	\section{Executive Summary}
			
		In this report, we set out to develop a robust methodology to identify areas with ongoing gentrification. Despite ample anecdotal evidence, there is still no unifying framework that allows to pin down specific census tracts as subject to gentrification, let alone make conclusion about cause and effect of the phenomenon. Perhaps the starkest illustration of this is a recent study by Preis et al. \cite{Preis20} that applied four different methodologies to the Boston area and found only seven tracts identified as gentrifying or at risk by all four methods. Having reproduced the often-cited algorithm of Prof. Freeman from Columbia University \cite{Freeman05} (henceforth referred to as the Columbia or the Governing Magazine method) and compared it to the results of a group of researchers from UC Berkeley \cite{Chapple17}, we also found the number of overlapping tracts to be in low double digits. This result has often been attributed by researchers to the difference in city-specific assumptions about what gentrification is. Here, we propose a simple and elegant clustering algorithm that is theory-agnostic yet powerful in identifying areas that have meaningfully different statistical properties comparing to their population and that can serve as an aid in policy making. \\
		
		While the picture painted in the BuzzFeed article and the Governing report is that of newcomers (mostly white and better educated) displacing inhabitants of historically non-white neighbourhoods by pricing them out, averages taken across the metropolitan area don't yet lend support to this story. Over the course of 2009-18, the share of population with at least a bachelor's degree grew by only 2 p.p. and the share of Hispanic population (+3 p.p.) increased at the expense of white (-5 p.p.) and African American (-1 p.p.) groups (see Table \ref{tab:dist}). Correlations (see Figure \ref{fig:corr}), while being in line with the story, are modest in magnitude and don't indicate existence of strong linear relationships between variables (except in the case of race-based variables that are tied by linear relationship by definition and the link between higher educational attainment and income, which is not related to gentrification per se). Even more surprisingly, tracts identified as gentrifying based on the methodology designed by Governing \cite{Governing15} (relying on trends in education, income and home prices), do not reveal almost any pattern in the corresponding racial dynamic or crime data that we collected separately (see Figure \ref{fig:distr_gov}). \\

		Since there is no consensus about which properties a gentrifying tract should exhibit, this problem cannot be cast into a supervised classification problem for a machine learning algorithm. Therefore, without imposing any specific set of assumptions, we ran a series of unsupervised clustering algorithms to see if they can pick up some structure in the data. The results are very promising, as one can see in Figure \ref{fig:distr}. Out of $\approx$4,000 census tracts in New York metropolitan area, our best iteration of K-Means Clustering algorithm found a cluster of 130 tracts that all exhibit the pattern described by BuzzFeed, i.e. an ongoing displacement of African American and Hispanic populations by educated white newcomers, associated with a rapid increase in median income and median house price. Statistical tests conducted to see if the distribution of changes in the analysed variables across all tracts is different from that for the cluster, all confirm that the distributions are distinct in statistical sense. In that group, which we will further refer to as gentrified tracts, average (across tracts) median (within tract) income increased by 86\% in 2009-18, the share of population with at least a bachelor's degree increased by 10 p.p. and an increase in the share of white population (+10 p.p.) was associated with a material decrease in non-white population (-6 p.p for African American and - 7 p.p. for Hispanic).

		Out of 130 tracts identified as distinct by K-Means Clustering and interpreted as gentrifying by us, only 14 overlap with tracts picked by our implementation of the Governing methodology. However, 106 tracts in the cluster are classified by the group of researchers from UC Berkeley as undergoing some form of exclusion or gentrification, ranging from "Ongoing Exclusion" to "Advanced Gentrification". \\
		
		In order to ensure the validity of our findings out-of-sample, we reserve several variables as external, following a similar approach taken by Freeman \cite{Freeman05}. One of reserved variables is the percentage change in the number of violent crimes committed on the territory of a tract and sourced from Crime Open Data Base (CODE) for over 1,000 census tracts in New York City. Here the difference between gentrified and non-gentrified tracts is not so stark but still supports our thesis: while the number of violent crimes declined by 4.6\% in NYC over 2009-18, it fell by 8.5\% in gentrified tracts. Figure \ref{fig:crime} illustrates this point as more tracts identified by our algorithm as gentrifying saw a material decrease in violent crime rates, comparing to the all tracts in New York City for which crime data was available.

		\end{figure}
		
	    The other way that we check if our methodology offers new insights into the effects of gentrification is by studying Manhattan's real estate market in depth. We dedicate Section \ref{case_study} of the report to this case study. In summary, our K-means clustering algorithm is better able to find tracts that exhibit higher rates of property price growth than in surrounding tracts that haven't been identified as undergoing/undergone gentrification. Our method is able to identify these areas sooner and with key insight that alludes to one key indicator of gentrification: an increased desirability and demand for properties. However, the Columbia method was better able to find gentrified tracts with higher rates of eviction suggesting an increased rate of displacement of residential tenants in these tracts - another key indicator of gentrification. Figures \ref{methods_summary_plot} and \ref{evictions} demonstrate these effects. We conclude that neither method wholly captures what gentrification is and suggest future work in extending the K-means method or other clustering methods forward with the inclusion of rental data to better identify gentrification.

		\subsection{Governing Magazine Methodology to Identify Gentrified Tracts}
			
			\subsubsection{Gentrification Criteria and Data Availability}
			
			According to the methodology developed by Governing and implemented by BuzzFeed \cite{BuzzFeed}, the criteria for a tract to be eligible to gentrify are:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item tract is in the bottom 40\% for median house value and income
					\item tract has the population of at least 500 people
				\end{itemize}
			If the above criteria are met, then to establish gentrification, the following criteria are used:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item inflation-adjusted house prices have gone up
					\item increase in inflation-adjusted home price is in the top third of all tracts
					\item increase in educational attainment is in the top third of all tracts
				\end{itemize}
			The corresponding criterion for gentrification is known to be one of the strictest compared to other studies \cite{Bhavsar20}, hence only 1.6\% of the tracts are classed as gentrified by the end of 2018. One of the possible reasons is that according to the methodology, if data on any of the above criteria is not available, the tract is not eligible to gentrify, which is highly relevant for the census data as many values for house prices were replaced with a large negative placeholder value. Having those in the data shifts the actual value of the 40\textsuperscript{th} percentile for median house price and affects the results of the algorithm. \\
			
			We first reconstructed the method as is and ran it on the tracts data in 2009 and 2018. It was found that 79 tracts were classified as gentrified, however 13 of them have missing median house price data, which makes these tracts not eligible to gentrify in the first place. We replaced all missing or invalid values with NaN, such that the percentile calculation ignores them but the data point itself is preserved as to not distort the distribution of other variables. This alternative implementation of the BuzzFeed algorithm identified 66 tracts as having gentrified. Taking a closer look, it can be noticed that all the tracts identified by our algorithm are identified by the baseline algorithm as well. That brings us to conclusion that our algorithm is more accurate than the baseline BuzzFeed algorithm, since it satisfies all the necessary criteria without dropping any tracts from the analysis completely and losing information.
			
			\subsubsection{Comparing Eligible and Gentrified Tracts}
			Below we compare the distributions of changes in variables for tracts that gentrified and tracts that were eligible but did not. It can be seen that by imposing a somewhat arbitrary cutoff point on two variables (median house prices and educational attainment), the method also affects the distributions of other variables (including income and racial variables) but not in a particularly meaningful way. Those tracts that the algorithm identified as gentrifying actually saw negative dynamic (on average) for all three racial groups we are considering in our analysis, which doesn't fit the very definition of gentrification that Governing sets. Moreover, some of the tracts that saw an increase in educated population are completely excluded from the sample. At the same time, the distributions of changes in variables for tracts that were eligible to gentrify but didn't, don't show material differences in statistical properties from the distributions for all tracts in the area. In our view, this calls for a different approach, not based on theory-driven and somewhat artificial constraints imposed on the data.

		\subsection{Clustering Algorithm to Identify Gentrified Tracts}
	        Since we operated under the assumption that the distribution of changes in selected variables over 2009-18 period should differ between the population of all tracts and the sample of tracts labelled as gentrified, our first step was to apply Isolation Forest as an outlier detection algorithm and see if the points that it selects as outliers can be interpreted as gentrifying tracts. In Isolation Forest, the process of constructing a decision tree with random splits, that divide up an $n$-dimensional space using orthogonal cuts, is repeated to create an ensemble. For each data point, the average number of splits required to isolate the point is a metric for the regularity or normality of the point. The algorithm has the added benefit of random splits being computationally cheap and averaging across all trees considers the multiple manners to isolate the data. The downside is that "contamination", i.e. the share of points to be selected as outliers, is a hyperparameter of the algorithm and we would like to avoid specifying that ex-ante. However, having run the algorithm for a grid containing different possible values of contamination, we did not identify a set of points that would possess characteristics allowing us to interpret them as gentrifying tracts.\\
	        
	        One of the complications that we were facing in working with available data was that only two variables (change in median household income and change in median home value), explained over 94\% of variance in the data set. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pca}, the first two principal components of standardized data basically coincide with the above mentioned variables. This property of the data makes separating it along all dimensions more challenging than if the features were distributed more similarly.
	        
	            \begin{figure}[H]
				    \centering
				    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figs/"pca_results.png"}
				    \caption{First Two Principal Components vs. Original Data}
				    \label{fig:pca}
			    \end{figure}
	            
	        Naturally, we turned our attention to clustering algorithms that separate unlabelled data in feature space. The first such algorithm that we tried was Gaussian Mixture, that produces probabilistic cluster definitions. However, having conducted both D'Agostino-Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests for the distributions of changes in independent variables (that can be see in Figure \ref{fig:distr}), we did not identify a single distribution that would be statistically indistinguishable from normal. In addition, despite our expectation that the clusters have elongated form, which Gaussian Mixture is good at identifying, it did not pick up any cluster that would possess the properties consistent with gentrification phenomenon. \\
	 
	        Our second choice, the K-Means Clustering algorithm, actually performed much better and finally allowed us to separate the data in a way that was consistent with the definition of gentrification. The clusters in this algorithm are chosen to reduce the inertia, the within cluster sum of square distance, and therefore the objective function is

            $$ \min_{C_k} \sum_{k} \sum_{X_j \in  C_k} \| X_j  - \mu_k \|^2. $$

            The centroid of a cluster $\mu_k$ is equal to

            $$ \mu_k = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{X_j \in C_k} X_j, $$

            where $|C_k|$ is the number of points in cluster $k$. The components of the centroid are equal to the mean of each feature of all points assigned to the cluster. After choosing the starting locations of each cluster's centroid randomly, it:
                
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item assigns each point to a cluster based on which cluster centroid it's the closest to
                    \item calculates the centroid of resulting cluster using the points that have been assigned to the cluster
                    \item repeats the above steps until convergence is met
                \end{enumerate}
            
            While the algorithm is guaranteed to converge, it will not converge to the global minimum. It is a greedy algorithm in a sense that it is relatively quick to run but we are at risk of obtaining a suboptimal solution and different starting positions will result in different solutions. To counteract reporting local minimum as our final result, we ran the algorithm thirty times and choose the best iteration. We also experimented with the number of clusters and ended up obtaining the best results when we set the number of clusters equal to eight, the number of categories the group of UC Berkeley researchers used to classify stages of gentrification. It is important to note that, while the number of tracts in each cluster almost exactly coincided with the distribution produced by that group, there was very little overlap in the correspondence of each category to our clusters. Final clustering distribution is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:kmeans-clusters} below and the significance of the result is best illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:distr}.
